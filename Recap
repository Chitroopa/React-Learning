-What is state?
  The idea is when the user see someting new on the screen its tracked as a state. Its a two way data binding.
  ex: Whenever the user types in a input box. Each and every character entered is creating a event and that event repalces the current value of the state. both old state and new states are stored so its easy for debugging. 
-useState syntax
  const [variableName, setterForTheVariableName] = useState(intialValue)
  ex const[isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(True)
